My name is Fu Enpei, a stuent from Northwest A&F University Sophomore in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering. Now, under the guidance of my tutor, I am studying drought variability analysis in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor region, and I am learning to use Python and Matlab to batch process meteorological data. This process is challenging for me, but I am eager for all of this. I hope to learn more at github
